# RADIUS Server assignment
This project implements a RADIUS Server that offers services to a RADIUS Client that uses PAP over UDP.

The implementation is derived from [RFC 2865](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2865),
although only a subset of the functionality specified therein has been implemented.
